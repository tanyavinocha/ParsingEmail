# ParsingEmail
###### For the given task I've used the technique webscraping as our task was to find a simple solution for that
So basically first i've uploaded the given html file on the local server because you cannot do scraping on the file saved locally on computer.
After this i've used libraries like beautifulsoup, requests and json to do the assigned task.
I've done this using the simplest method i.e webscrapping using python language.
And at the end stored the data into json file.

This particular method is specific for the just the given file.
I can also make a generalised algorithm/program for the given scenario that can be used for all the emails to perform the same function.
But for now  i did this because we were asked to solve the given problem in the easiest way.
Therefore the simple method which is applicable only for the given problem and works fine on all operating systems
